I didn't appreciate the phrase ""hangingEvery time I finish a Zweig novel, I bring the book to my lap, leaving myself speechless at what I just read. I didn't appreciate the phrase ""hanging on to every word"" until my first introduction to Zweig, Chess Story. 24hrs carries on that appreciation!Zweig takes Chess Story, Letter from an Unknown Woman, and this novella into a common setup: he places you in the role of an unbeknown character who meets an impressionable stranger. From that point on, the stranger recalls an epic adventure to us. Vices, obsessions, and confessions all come out in great detail, all of which I can greatly empathize with, despite someone reading this almost 100 years after publication. The title of this book lives up to expectations, as a woman recounts a day in her life in a near hour-by-hour refrain. The story brought back feelings of my first love, heartbreak, addiction, and recognition of mortality.I implore anyone I meet to read a Zweig novella or two! Read Chess Story, then this one. They're no longer than 100 pages, and everyone I've ever known who read them did so in less than two days.
